Contributions are welcome.  Due to the nature of Portage, merging changes could prove difficult, especially as users are expected to only take from this configuration what they find useful.  USE flag changes, for example, are likely not to be accepted.  New compiler flags however could be, particularly if they give the compiler more freedom to make decisions.  Contributions must keep in the philosophy stated in the README.  No contributions will be accepted that override the compiler's better judgement.
